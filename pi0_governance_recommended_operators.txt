PI0 GOVERNANCE MODULE - RECOMMENDED OPERATORS
============================================

Based on the simulation of multidimensional governance interactions,
PI0 System recommends the following operators and configurations to
capture the complexity of governance structures:

- Compliance: GovernanceComplianceOperator with dynamic weighting (range 0.8 - 1.2)
- Payroll: GovernancePayrollOperator adjusted by business type (non-profit, for-profit, tax status)
- Taxation: GovernanceTaxOperator applying adaptive tax collection with decay functions
- Risk Management: Composite operator combining weighted outputs of Compliance and Taxation
- Community Engagement: Operator measuring external relations; not explicitly implemented in this module

These recommendations leverage the guiding principle (g4=1) allowing modular and flexible
adoption of governance practices tailored to unique organizational needs.

PI0 SYSTEM COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED FUNCTIONS MODULE
===================================================

Version: 1.0.0
Created: 2025-03-25 20:45:10
Dimensions: 4
Default Decay Factor: 0.95

This module implements a comprehensive PI0 System with integrated lossless and lossy functions,
visualization capabilities, and advanced mathematical operations. The system maintains perfect
precision internally while simulating natural decay in external communications, providing a
fluid calculator interface that can operate in different modes.

CORE FUNCTIONS:
--------------

1. lossless_calculate(expression, variables=None)
   - Performs exact mathematical calculations with full precision.
   - Used internally by the PI0 System to maintain perfect accuracy.
   - Returns solutions and explanations without any decay or loss.

2. lossy_calculate(expression, variables=None, decay_factor=None)
   - Applies a controlled decay to the lossless results to simulate external communications.
   - The decay factor determines how much information is lost in transmission.
   - Returns both the original lossless results and the decayed lossy results.

3. fluid_calculate(expression, variables=None, decay_factor=None, mode='integrated')
   - The main interface for the PI0 System calculator.
   - Can operate in three modes:
     * 'lossless': Returns only the internal, precise calculations.
     * 'lossy': Returns only the external, decayed calculations.
     * 'integrated': Returns both lossless and lossy results with a comprehensive explanation.

4. visualize_function(func_str, x_range=(-5, 5), num_points=100, decay_factor=None)
   - Visualizes a mathematical function in both lossless and lossy representations.
   - Generates a plot showing the difference between internal and external representations.
   - Saves the visualization to a file and returns the data.

INTERNAL MECHANISMS:
------------------

- _encode_value(value): Transforms values into the PI0 internal representation using a 4-dimensional space.
- _decode_value(encoded_value): Transforms PI0 internal representations back to standard values.
- _apply_decay(value, decay_factor): Applies a controlled decay to simulate lossy communications.
- _initialize_transformations(): Sets up the transformation matrices for the PI0 internal space.

USAGE EXAMPLES:
-------------

1. Creating a PI0 System instance:
   ```python
   pi0 = PI0SystemComprehensive(decay_base=0.95, random_seed=42, dimensions=4)
   ```

2. Performing a lossless calculation:
   ```python
   result = pi0.lossless_calculate("x**2 - 16 = 0")
   print(result['solutions'])  # [4.0, -4.0]
   ```

3. Performing a lossy calculation:
   ```python
   result = pi0.lossy_calculate("x**2 - 16 = 0", decay_factor=0.9)
   print(result['lossy']['solutions'])  # Approximately [3.6, -3.6] with some random variation
   ```

4. Using the fluid calculator in integrated mode:
   ```python
   result = pi0.fluid_calculate("x**2 - 16 = 0", decay_factor=0.9, mode='integrated')
   print(result['integrated_explanation'])  # Comprehensive explanation of both calculation paths
   ```

5. Visualizing a function:
   ```python
   result = pi0.visualize_function("sin(x) * exp(-x/10)", x_range=(-10, 10), num_points=200)
   # Saves a visualization to a file and returns the data
   ```

The PI0 System is designed to be fluid and functional, providing a seamless experience
across internal and external representations while maintaining the integrity of the
mathematical calculations.
